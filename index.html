         <h2 class="subHeading">Screaming: Tantrum City</h2>
         <p>Many are familiar with the term "the terrible twos." Well, no mere words can convey just how terrible they
            can be. Just... full on meltdowns about NOTHING. The wailing. The tears. The embarrasment when it happens
            out in public, even though we shouldn't be embarrassed because let's be serious, you're kids have meltdowns,
            too! My personal favorite: going to pick her up and as soon as I touch her she magically turn into a
            marshmallow and collapses on the floor, making it look like I literally just <b><em>yeeted</em></b> her
            forcefully into the ground. Let's not talk about the fact that she screams when happy too...</p>

         <h2 class="subHeading">Sleeping... Or Lack Thereof</h2>
         <p>Two words: sleep regressions. No fun. Hard pass. I wish I could just say hard pass. Multiple wakings in the
            middle of the night. Refusing sleep until 10-11 pm. Waking up at 5 am. Hating naps. I think she's using
            sleep deprivation as a reprogramming tactic so I'll give her all of the cookies. <small>Send help.</small>

         <p>She makes so many decisions that would in some way, shape, or form unalive her, even though it's my express
            duty to keep her alive. Standing on bikes. Pulling dogs' tails. Diving headfirst off of furniture. Why are
            you like this!?</p>
